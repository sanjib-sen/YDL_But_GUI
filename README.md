# YDL_But_GUI

Looking for Description? It basically is in the name. It is based on youtube-dl but for normal people. Plus, you will get most of the beautiful features of youtube-dl with constant updates and somewhat decent **(!)** UI. Apparently this is my first Software and I am looking for the Feedbacks.

## Alpha Version Notes

1. I still didn't manage to set ***Environmental Path Variable*** without requiring Adminstration Priviliges.  I am working with that Right Now. Until I finally fix this, you have change the ***PATH*** using Command Prompt. Don't worry, it is just one command, requires only once.

2. I will release the .exe file after fixing the PATH issues.

3. More Features are coming. Check the Upcoming Section.

4. There are still a lot of bugs here and there. I couldn't give enought time to the project because of Academic (University Life) Pressure. I will continue to fix most of the bugs in a week.

5. (Contributors Only): The variable names used in this softwares are very bad and not convenient. It is because of the lack of time and sleep I got duing the development. (I feel like a drunk person). Also it is my first project.
